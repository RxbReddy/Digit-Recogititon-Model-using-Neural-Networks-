# Digit-Recognition-Model-using-Neural-Networks-

### Intoduction
MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

### Aim of the project
In this project, our goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. 

### Skills
1. Computer vision fundamentals including simple neural networks
2. Classification methods such as SVM and K-nearest neighbors

### Files

#### Data
We have imported the MNIST Digit Recognizer datatset which is available on Kaggle directly onto Google Colab by leveraging the Kaggle API. Accessing the data from using these API’s reduced the dependency of the code on a particular file. This enabled the code to run on any machine with a valid Kaggle API Token in it.

#### Model
This folder contains the python notebook. It can run on any machine making it easy to access. The model that we have bulit have given us an accuracy of 99.2%.

#### Project Description
This document gives you a gist of what the project is and what are the methods we used in cleaning and processing the data, testing and training the data and also, the libraries that we used to build the model.

### Tools
To set up and run this project you will need the following tools:
1. MS Excel
2. Python 3.0.0+ / Anaconda / Jupyter Lab / Google Colab

Please make sure that you have installed all the libraries used in the project if you're on any other apart from Google Colab.

### Final Thoughts
The model that we have bulit have given us an accuracy of 99.2%.
